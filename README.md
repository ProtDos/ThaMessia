Ok so, I stopped programming. Too much hate and too much moking made me stop programming. Programming is my passion so sometimes I'll just 
continue my projects for fun like DivineBooter, but I won't be as active as I was before the hate moments. For two years I tried to change
italian programming communities' mind (because I was one of the most hated people in the italian communities) and the fact that the hate
is continuing to exist even over Italy makes me somehow sad. I want to say thanks to many people who helped me in this journey:

LoRy24, that introduced me to Minecraft protocol and Java's basics
GaMMy55_, my favourite pupil that motivated me to learn in order to teach
Clo568_, that gave me motivation in order to continue DivineBooter (yes I have my ways to impress girls)
GaKer, that helped me find bugs in my old programming language SoulC
stratosamu, my dear brother who taught me a lot of things and made this journey possible
Alberto Olla, a guy that helped me having fun while watching at his weird and seductive JavaScript tutorials.

Thank you guys for what you gave me. See you in heaven. (don't think I've commited *that* thing lol, it's just that I won't see some people anymore so yeah)
